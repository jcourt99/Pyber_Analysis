# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview of Pyber Analysis

The company, V. Isualize, asked for an analysis of six key metrics for their ride-share operation in different types of cities (urban, suburban, and rural). The company would like recommendations on how to address disparities between the three different city types. 

## Results

Using data from 120 cities and 2375 rides, the analysis totals for the key metrics are populated in the chart below:

### Total Rides by City Type
This metric shows a large discrepancy between the rural and urban areas use of a ride-share option. Rural cities account for only 5% of the total rides. While urban cities claim 69% of the total rides.

### Total Drivers by City Type
The number of drivers in the rural areas makes up for 3% of the total drivers. The urban cities have 81% of the total drivers for those large metropolitan areas. 

### Total Fares by City Type
Comparing the total fares to the total rides by city type, shows a consistent percentage. For example, about 30% of the fares coming from suburban cities which is close to the 26% of the total rides in suburban cities.

### Average Fare per Ride
In rural areas, the average fare is about $10.00 higher than in urban areas. This difference may be due to the miles driven in rural areas versus urban areas. The suburban average fare is inbetween the rural and urban fares.

### Average Fare per Driver
With urban areas claiming 81% of the total drivers, the average fare per driver is the smallest at $16.57. The rural average fare per driver is the highest at $55.49, but there are significantly fewer drivers in the rural areas.

### Total Fare by City Type for January to May 2019
Plotting the three city types allows the analysis of peak weeks during the months of January to May 2019. January was a lower fare month for the urban cities. All three city types fares were the highest during the third week of February. The rural area hit another high point for fares during the first week of April. The suburban areas reached another peak time during the third week of April. While the urban areas fares stayed between about $1600 and $2500 for the four month period.


## Summary
The PyBer summary chart indicates a few discrepancies between the three different city type markets for the ride-share company. A few recommendations based on the analysis can be made:
1. Increasing the number of drivers in the rural areas will allow for more rides, especially if the rides involve more mileage due to a larger area to cover.
2. Instituting a higher fare for urban areas will give the drivers a larger profit for the shorter trips. 
3. Increasing the number of drivers in the urban areas will keep up with demand, especially during the peak week in April.
